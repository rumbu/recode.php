recode.php
Convert all files in project folder from cp-1251 to utf-8

This small script I wrote for php project in cp1251 encoding.
In one beautiful day I moved a DB to UTF8 and all files also need to be recoded.

Usage:
* activate the iconv php extension (http://www.php.net/iconv)
* put script to a project upper-folder
* run "php recode.php -p www", where www is your directory to be recoded
* .php, .tpl, .conf, .inc - are target for recoding by default, but you can easiliy change it
* script detects if file is already in UTF8 and don't proceed file twice on second run
